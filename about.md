![Me]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/myphoto.jpg){:width="400px"}

My name is Parth Jatakia, and I am in a state of transition from being an undergraduate to being a Ph.D. student. I will be joining Princeton as a Ph.D. student in this coming Fall. However, it seems coronavirus will most likely throw cold water on this plan and will have to defer by a semester. 

I finished my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Engineering Physics (Dual Degree Program) at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. During this period, I have been fortunate to work closely with some of the most dynamic and brilliant researchers/professors - [Prof. Kasturi Saha](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/kasturis), [Prof. Sai Vinjanampathy](http://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/physics/en/content/sai-vinjanampathy), and [Prof. Suddhasatta Mahapatra](http://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/en/employee-profile/dr-suddhasatta-mahapatra-1). I have worked on the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center and its application under Prof. Kasturi and Prof. Sai's guidance. With Prof. Suddhasatta, I have worked on fabricating spin qubit architecture using quantum dots in silicon.

As the name of the blog would suggest, I am interested in anything related to quantum. I am excited about developing theory, components and tools that will hopefully one day be crucial for building revolutionary quantum technologies. I am planning to work on such problems statements during my PhD. This website's purpose is partially for showcasing and partially for documenting this journey of learning, building and tinkering with everything related to quantum.

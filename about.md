![Me]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/myphoto.jpg){:width="400px"}

My name is Parth Jatakia, and apparently, I am stuck at a transition point of being an undergraduate to being a Ph.D. student. I am planning to join Princeton as a Ph.D. student in this coming Fall. However, it seems coronavirus will most likely throw cold water on this plan and will cause me to defer by a semester. 

I finished my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Engineering Physics (Dual Degree Program) at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. During this period, I have been fortunate to work closely with some of the most dynamic professors and brilliant researchers - [Prof. Kasturi Saha](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/kasturis), [Prof. Sai Vinjanampathy](http://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/physics/en/content/sai-vinjanampathy), and [Prof. Suddhasatta Mahapatra](http://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/en/employee-profile/dr-suddhasatta-mahapatra-1). I have worked on the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center and its application under Prof. Kasturi and Prof. Sai's guidance. With Prof. Suddhasatta, I have worked on fabricating spin qubit architecture using quantum dots in silicon.
